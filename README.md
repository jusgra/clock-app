# Analog Clock [webpage](https://jusgra.github.io/clock-app/)
## Working analog clock, that displays real time. Got an idea from the internet, since I need practice, I thought why not make it myself?

### June 12th commit
- Initial working clock commit with no CSS

### June 14th commit
- Added pretty CSS
- Someone made the clock run backwards, but it still shows the correct time, so decided to keep it that way

### June 16th commit
- Added range input for clock size option;
- Made the clock look little more "backward". If you can't tell the time, there's a help option hidden behind the **?**
