# Analog Clock [webpage](https://jusgra.github.io/clock-app/)
## Working analog clock, that displays real time. Got an idea from the internet, since I need practice, I thought why not make it myself?

### June 12th push
- Initial working clock commit with no CSS

### June 14th push
- Added pretty CSS
- Someone made the clock run backwards, but it still shows the correct time, so decided to keep it that way

### June 16th push
- Added range input for clock size option
- Made the clock look little more "backward" by inverting the numbers on the clock itself
- Text below clock can now flip if you find a way to do that

### June 18th push (probably the last update)
- Changed color pallet
- Decided to go back to numberless clock design, I think it better suits page idea
- Added color picker for clock background
- Text below clock will tell you the current time once you find the hidden button
- Added a "sneaky" HELP button that once pressed will reveal an alert box that can help you find the secret hint
