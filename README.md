# Analog Clock
Working analog clock, that displays real time. Got an idea from the internet, since I need practice, thought why not make it myself?

### June 12th commit
Initial working clock commit, no CSS. Still have some thoughts on changing the design a little bit.

### June 14th commit
Added pretty CSS, and someone made the clock run backwards, but it still shows the correct time, so decided to keep it that way.

### June 16th commit
Added range input for clock size option, made the clock look little more "backward". If you can't tell the time, there's a help option hidden behind the **?**
